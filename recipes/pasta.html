    <h2>Let's learn how to make pasta!</h2>
    <p>Today we will learn how to make a pizza at home</p>
    <h3>Ingredients Required</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup Penne Pasta or any Pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>4-5 cups Water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped Garlic, optional</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons Maida (all purpose flour)</li>
        <li>1½ cups Milk (250 ml)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried Oregano, optional (or pizza seasonings)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Red Chilli Flakes</li>
        <li>A pinch of Black Pepper Powder (or crushed pepper)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1 - Boil raw pasta according to the instructions given on the package or follow following instructions;
            Take 4-5 cups water
            in deep sauce pan, bring it to boil over medium flame. When it start boiling, add 3/4 cup Penne pasta and
            1/2 teaspoon
            salt.</li>
        <li>step-2
            Boil them until al-dente (cooked but not very soft). It will take around 10-12 minutes. To check whether
            pasta is cooked
            or not, take one pasta in a fork and bite it. If it is little firm to bite, it is cooked. If it is too hard
            to bite, it
            requires more cooking.</li>
        <li>step-3
            Transfer cooked pasta to a large colander and drain excess water.</li>
        <li>step-4
            While pasta is cooking, heat 1/2 teaspoon oil in a pan or kadai over high flame. Add 1/4 cup chopped carrot,
            1/4 cup
            chopped green capsicum, 1/4 cup chopped red capsicum, 1/4 cup chopped broccoli and salt.</li>
        <li>step-5
            Stir and cook until veggies are little cooked but still crunchy, for around 2-3 minutes. Turn off the flame
            and transfer
            them to a plate.</li>
        <li>step-6
            Heat 1½ tablespoons butter in the same pan or kadai over medium flame. Add 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped
            garlic and sauté
            for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>step-7
            Add 1½ tablespoons maida (all purpose flour).</li>
        <li>step-8
            Stir continuously and cook for a minute.</li>
        <li>step-9
            Pour 1½ cups milk little by little while stirring continuously with a whisk.</li>
        <li>step-10
            Stir and mix for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>step-11
            Reduce flame to low. Continue stirring and cooking until mixture starts to thicken. It will take around 3-4
            minutes
            depending on the size and thickness of the pan. When mixture starts to coat the back of a spoon as shown in
            the picture
            here, it means that it has started to thicken.</li>
        <li> step-12
            Add 1/4 teaspoon oregano, 1/4 teaspoon red chilli flakes, a pinch of black pepper powder and salt.</li>
        <li>step-13
            Mix well.</li>
        <li>step-14
            Add sautéed vegetables and pasta.</li>
        <li>step-15
            Turn off the flame. Mix well.</li>
        <li>step-16
            Transfer it to a serving plate. White sauce pasta is now ready. Garnish it with grated cheese and serve
            while they are
            still hot.</li>
